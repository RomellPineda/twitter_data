# Project 2: Analysis of Twitter Data

## Work Flow
Recommended work flow for code changes is as follows:

From **main** branch run

`git pull`

Create new feature branch

`git checkout -b <my_branchname-developer_alias>`

Make code changes and then...

```
git add <my_changes>
git commit -m 'added my changes'
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout <my_branchname...>
git rebase main -i
```
> Squash commits and resolve merge conflicts as needed

```
git checkout main
git push origin <my_branchname...>
```
Notify team member of pending review


## Conflict Resolution Plan
In the unlikely event that team members encounter an unresolvable issue between themselves, a knowledgeable, neutral third-party will be consulted to aid in resolution.  However, team members are encouraged to resolve all issues internally.
